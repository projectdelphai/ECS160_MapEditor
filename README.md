# ECS160Tools

## Usage
Check the bin directory for compiled packages.

## Building
### macOS
Use Qt Creator build a release version. Then run QT_DIR/5.7/clang_64/bin/macdeployqt BUILD_PATH/MapEditor.app to deploy
Use -dmg to convert to dmg file.


## Map files
The map package file is a renamed ZIP file with file extension .mpk .
This package's directory structure is as follows:
```
	.mpk
		|--- /index.dat
		|--- /data.map
		|--- /img/
		|--- /res/
		|--- /scripts/
		|--- /snd/
		|--- /upg/
```

The index.dat file lists all included files(excluding empty directories) in the package.
Each subdirectory contains custom asset files that must be overwritten upon loading the map.
More info on the data.map file:

### The data.map file
The file structure is as follows:
- Mapname
- Xsize Ysize
- Description
- AI types available
- Map ASCII
	* Note: Each letter corresponds to a tile, and there must be a one-unit border around the entire mapset (so 96x64 needs 98x66 characters)
	```
	# from /src/TerrainMap.cpp
	case 'G':   Grass;
  case 'F':   Tree;
  case 'D':   Dirt;
  case 'W':   Wall;    
  case 'w':   WallDamaged;
  case 'R':   Rock;
  case ' ':   Water;
  ```
- Number of players
- Resource values
	* Global Cap:  
	`0 30000 500 ==> Maximum any player can have is 30000 gold, 500 lumber`
	* PlayerNum GoldStarting LumberStarting  
	`1 1000 0 => player 1 starts with 1000 gold, 0 lumber`
- Number of units to render (should match number of lines below)
- Buildings and Units
	* `Name PlayerNum X Y`
	* 0 for neutral
	```
	# more unit names TBA 
	GoldMine 0 1 12 
	GoldMine 0 92 49 
	Peasant 1 3 4
	TownHall 1 3 5
	Peasant 2 94 59    
	TownHall 2 92 54
	```
